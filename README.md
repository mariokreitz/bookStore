# 📚 BookStore

Welcome to **BookStore** — a simple and clean template website that serves as a foundation for experimenting with JavaScript templates and data fetching. This project fetches data from a local JSON file and renders it dynamically using JavaScript templates.

## 🌟 Features

- **Static Data Fetching**: Fetches book data from a local JSON file.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Renders book information using JavaScript templates.
- **Experimentation-Friendly**: Ideal for testing and experimenting with various JavaScript templating engines and data-fetching techniques.
- **Foundation for Future Features**: Serve as a base for adding new features like search, filtering, and more.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine (optional, for local server setup)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other editor of your choice.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookStore.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd bookStore
   ```

3. **Open the Project in Your Code Editor**:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

4. **Run a Local Server** (Optional, for live reloading):
   If you want to run a local server, you can use the built-in VS Code extensions or Node.js packages like `http-server`:
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```
   Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.

### Usage

- Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the bookstore template.
- The book data is located in the `bookstore.json` file within the `data` directory.
- Modify the JSON file to see the changes rendered on the website.
- Experiment with the JavaScript templates in the `script/templates/` directory and the main logic in `app.js` or `script/fetchData.js`.

## 🛠️ Customization

Feel free to customize the project to fit your needs:

- **Add More Data**: Expand the `bookstore.json` file with more book entries.
- **Enhance Templates**: Modify the JavaScript templates in the `script/templates/` folder to include more data points like author, publication date, etc.
- **Style the Template**: Update the `style.css` file or add more stylesheets in `assets/styles/` to give the template a new look and feel.
